## üîß Technical Details

### How It Works

**Voice Volume:**
```javascript
[0:a]volume=${voiceVol}[voice]
```
- Applied to voiceover audio
- Multiplies original volume
- 1.0 = no change, 2.0 = double volume

**Music Volume with Fades:**
```javascript
[1:a]volume=${musicVol},
     aloop=loop=-1:size=2e+09,
     atrim=0:${duration},
     afade=t=in:st=0:d=${fadeIn},
     afade=t=out:st=${fadeOutStart}:d=${fadeOut}[music]
```
- Applies volume
- Loops music if shorter than video
- Trims to video length
- Fades in at start
- Fades out at end

**Mixing:**
```javascript
[voice][music]amix=inputs=2:duration=first[mixed]
```
- Combines voice and music
- Uses voice duration as master
- No clipping (proper mixing)

### Video Fade Effects

Voice fade settings also control video fades:
- **Fade In:** Uses `CONFIG.audio.voiceFadeIn`
- **Fade Out:** Uses `CONFIG.audio.voiceFadeOut`
- Applied to both video and audio for sync

## üéØ Best Practices

### 1. Start with Presets
- Use presets first
- Only go custom if you need to
- Presets cover 90% of use cases

### 2. Test and Iterate
- Generate a test video with short clip
- Check audio balance
- Adjust if needed
- Then do full production

### 3. Consider Your Platform
- **YouTube:** Default or Music Louder
- **TikTok/Instagram:** Music Louder (engagement)
- **Educational:** Music Subtle
- **Podcast:** Voice Boost

### 4. Voice Quality Matters
- Good recording = 1.0 volume works great
- Poor recording = Use Voice Boost preset
- Don't boost above 1.5 (distortion risk)

### 5. Music Selection
- Instrumental works best
- Avoid music with lyrics (competes with voice)
- Choose appropriate energy level
- Match music to content mood

### 6. Fade Guidelines
- **Short fades (1-2s):** Modern, fast-paced
- **Medium fades (2-3s):** Professional standard
- **Long fades (4-5s):** Cinematic, emotional

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration File

All settings are in `src/index.js`:

```javascript
CONFIG.audio = {
  voiceVolume: 1.0,      // 0.0 to 2.0
  musicVolume: 0.35,     // 0.0 to 1.0
  musicFadeIn: 2,        // seconds
  musicFadeOut: 3,       // seconds
  voiceFadeIn: 1,        // seconds (also controls video fade)
  voiceFadeOut: 1        // seconds (also controls video fade)
}
```

Advanced users can edit these directly to set defaults.

## ‚ùì FAQ

**Q: Can I have different volumes for different sections?**

**Q: My voice is too quiet even at 200%?**
A: Pre-process your voiceover file to increase volume in audio editor before using.

**Q: Music fades sound abrupt?**
A: Try longer fade durations (4-5 seconds) for smoother transitions.

**Q: Can I have music without voiceover?**
A: Not currently - the tool is designed for voiceover + optional music. Use just music file without background_music.mp3 for music-only.
